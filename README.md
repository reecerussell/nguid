# nguid

nguid is a state-of-the-art command-line tool used to generate GUID (globally unique identifiers). Written in Go, nguid is super speedy and lightweight, so you'll never be left GUID-less.

## Getting started

If you have Golang installed, nguid can be installed by running the following:

```
go install github.com/reecerussell/nguid
```
